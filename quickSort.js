/**
 * QUICK SORT
 *
 * - Like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays
 * of 0 or 1 element are always sorted.
 * - Works by selecting on element (called the 'pivot')
 * and finding the index where the pivot should
 * end up in the sorted array.
 * - Once the pivot is position appropriately, quick sort
 * can be applied on either side of the pivot.
